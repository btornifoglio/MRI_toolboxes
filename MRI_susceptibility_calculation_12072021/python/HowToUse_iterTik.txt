Arguments:
field - The .nii file containing the field map (in ppm) 
mask - The .nii file containing the binary tissue mask
noise - The .nii file containing the noise map (up to a scaling factor)
output - The .nii file where the susceptibility map is to be saved (in ppm)

--- About the noise map ---
% The iterative fitting is weighted by the inverse of "noise" to assign lower 
% weights to less reliable (noisy) voxels. 
% For multi-echo data:
% Similarly to the MEDI method, this could be e.g. the dp1 output of the 
% Fit_ppm_complex (or Fit_ppm_complex_TE) function from the MEDI toolbox. 
% dp1 is actually equivalent to eq. 14 from Kressler et al. IEEE TMI 29.2
% (2009) and can be calculated using the multi-echo magnitude images.
% For single-echo data:
% The inverse of the magnitude image can be used as the noise map input as
% voxels with noisy phase also tend to have low magnitude.

Optional arguments:
resolution - Image space resolution (default = 1,1,1)
B0direction - B0 direction (default = 0,0,1)
alpha - Regularisation parameter (default = 0.05)
stopping - Iteration stopping threshold (norm(res)/norm(b)) (default = 0.03 = 3%)
